# Immediate tasks

- investigate nested and inline prefabs instantiation
  - forbid it by ignoring the command and warning the user?

- test shipping configuration from time to time
- test precompiled headers occasionally

# Optimization
- (?) smaller data types for ids

# Future features

- Material_Asset
  - (?) a separete Physics_Material_Asset, if ever needed
