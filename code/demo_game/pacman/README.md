# Summary
I want to build a simple Pac-Man game  
Data structure is based on "demo/tetris" initially  

See "demo_game/main.cpp" and "platform_windows/main.cpp"  

# Features I've got for the project
* Pathfinding (basic generic A*, not used here in the end)
* Generic memory allocation functions (no memory management yet)
* Generic array structure
* Game memory checksums for reinitialization

# To do
* Advance between levels
* Bonus drops
* Sprites and animations
* Automatic tile choice for walls?
* Cornering?
* Cruise Elroy
* Ghost house logic (in-between animations?!)
