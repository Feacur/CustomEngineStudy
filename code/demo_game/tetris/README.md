# Summary
Basic version of Tetris  

See "demo_game/main.cpp" and "platform_windows/main.cpp"  

### Algorithm
1) a random figure tries to spawn
2) if it can't then clear the field
3) move the figure by system and input
5) if the figure collides with the field then imprint it into
6) collapse filled rows of the field

### Thoughts
* Rotating a figure can be unintuitive
* Figure landing can be unintuitive
* Need to render smooth falling, probably

# Features I've got for the project
* Keyboard input
* Randomization functions (C stdlib, Lehmer)
